### Basic writing and formatting syntax.

#### 1.Using the python interpreter.
> The docs get to outline various ways of starting the python interpreter. 
     (i honestly didn't dwell on this and the commands as well since in the past i've not used them in any way)
     The commands included
                        : python-c command [arg]
                        
2. #### Invoking the interpreter.
(Same content as intro to the python interpreter.Looking forward to relate with this two.)
     
> Interpreter & its Environment.
   
   >>>>Source Coding & Encoding.
   -To declare an encoding other than the default one is to be used, this special line of code should be added to the first line of the file;
   # -*- coding: encoding -*-
   (where encoding is a valid codecs eg =cp1252) Also check the file to see the initial syntax without MD effect.
   -Incase the source code starts with a ##### UNIX "_shebang_" line ,the declaration should be added  as the second line of the file.
   
   

 3. #### Informal introduction to python.   
     comments in python are written by use of '#' before a line of code, in a white space, but never in a string literal.
     
    >>> Using python as a calculator.
      Numbers expression syntax still work like in other launguages and can be used for grouping.(+,=,*,/,) .
      
       Integers are numbers without the fractions eg 2,3,4,5, and are type 'int'.Numbers with fractions like 5.8,2.0 are identified as type float.
       To avoid getting any fractional result one can use (//).
       For calculation of power use (**) 
       
       Word [0(included):2(excluded] 
       
       [:2] from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
       [4:] from 4 (included to the end)
        
        The inbuilt function len() is supposed to return the length of a string.
       
       python also has built in support for complex numbers and uses 'j' or 'J' suffix to indicate the imaginary part eg (6+5j)
       
       
    >>> Strings.
        They are usually enclosed in single or double quotes. (" ") , (' ') .
        They can be joined together by use of '+' and repeated by use of '*' .
        
        Strings can be indexed by having the first character identified as  index (0) .
        Negative indices start from -1 since 0, is the same as -0 hence only acknowledging 0 from the left.
        You can also slice the characters to obtain sub strings eg [0:2]
        They are immutable.
        
        
        
    >>> Lists.
        They are written inside square brackets and separated with comas, eg [1,2,6,9,] , provided they are of the same type.
        They can also be indexed taking the first position as a 0.
        Unlike strings they are mutable.
        You can also add new items to the list using ; append () method.
        They can also be nested. thus creating lists that contain other lists.
