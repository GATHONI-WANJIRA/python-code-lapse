#### _1.Using the python interpreter_
> The docs get to outline various ways of starting the python interpreter. 
     (i honestly didn't dwell on this and the commands as well since in the past i've not used them in any way)
     The commands included
                        : python-c command [arg]
                        
2. #### Invoking the interpreter.
(Same content as intro to the python interpreter.Looking forward to relate with this two.)
     
> Interpreter & its Environment.
   
   >>>>Source Coding & Encoding.
   -To declare an encoding other than the default one is to be used, this special line of code should be added to the first line of the file;
   # -*- coding: encoding -*-
   (where encoding is a valid codecs eg =cp1252) Also check the file to see the initial syntax without MD effect.
   -Incase the source code starts with a ##### UNIX "_shebang_" line ,the declaration should be added  as the second line of the file.
   
   

 3. #### Informal introduction to python.
